### Hi! I'm Abigail. ðŸ‘‹

[![@licataae's Holopin board](https://holopin.me/licataae)](https://holopin.io/@licataae)

Iâ€™m a PhD student in neuroscience (Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School) researching cross-linguistic influence on semantic knowledge in multilingualism. During my bachelorâ€™s in neuroscience (University of Cincinnati) I investigated sound symbolism and cognition-emotion interactions in reading. I completed my masterâ€™s degree in neuro-cognitive psychology in Munich, Germany (LMU) where I examined language and cognitive performance alongside PET imaging in patients with primary progressive aphasia. After my masterâ€™s degree, I moved to San Francisco, California (UCSF) to work as a neuroimaging data assistant and to gain knowledge of multimodal imaging techniques for the visualization of neuroanatomical changes related to language dysfunction.

Iâ€™m interested in combining multimodal neuroimaging, neuropsychological assessment and multivariate statistical techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive correlates of semantic knowledge and control in multilingual speakers. My ultimate goal in this research is to apply findings in patient populations in order to improve treatment and care for patients with language disorders.

Outside of research I enjoy dancing, swimming, roller-skating, crafting, playing bass and generally trying out anything that interests me! Iâ€™m passionate about intersectional feminism, sustainability, and diversity and equity in academia. I believe open, FAIR and cross-cultural research in neuroscience is the only way we can achieve an accurate understanding of the brain.
